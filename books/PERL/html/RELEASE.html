<P>
<H1><A NAME="activeperl 5.6.1.635  release notes">ActivePerl 5.6.1.635 -- Release Notes</A></H1>
<P>Welcome, and thanks for downloading ActivePerl.  This release corresponds
to Perl version 5.6.1.</P>
<P>Please note that ActivePerl 600 series builds are NOT binary-compatible with
the older 500 series builds.  In particular, do not attempt to use extensions
or PPM packages built for the 500 series builds with ActivePerl 600 series
builds and vice versa.  This build is binary compatible with previous 600
series builds.</P>
<P>Binaries for the following platforms are available:</P>
<UL>
<LI>
Linux x86 for Red Hat 6.2 or later
<P></P>
<LI>
Linux x86 for Debian 2.2 or later
<P></P>
<LI>
Solaris sparc for Solaris 2.6 or later
<P></P>
<LI>
Windows x86 for Windows 9x, NT, Me, 2000 and XP
<P></P></UL>
<P>For a granular list of the changes included in this release, see 
the ActivePerl Change Log.</P>
<P>
<HR>
<H1><A NAME="incompatibilities">Incompatibilities</A></H1>
<P>The following list is a general summary of the known incompatibilities
between the 5.6.1 source code release and earlier releases.  Be sure to
consider these very carefully before upgrading.</P>
<UL>
<LI>
Compatibility macros for global variables are not available by
default, to control namespace pollution.  If older extensions don't
build because of missing symbols, try ``perl Makefile.PL POLLUTE=1''
first.
<P></P>
<LI>
Subroutines named CHECK are considered special, and will be
automatically executed when the compilation of the main program ends.
Rename such functions to lower/mixed case.
<P></P>
<LI>
$English::PERL_VERSION is now an alias for $^V (a string) rather
than $] (a number).  You may need to use the ``%vd'' sprintf format
to display this correctly.
<P></P>
<LI>
Literals of the form 1.2.3 parse as <CODE>chr(1) . chr(2) . chr(3)</CODE>
rather than as <CODE>&quot;1.2&quot; . 3</CODE>.
<P></P>
<LI>
<CODE>rand()</CODE> may yield a different (but usually more random) sequence due
to internal changes.
<P></P>
<LI>
Iterating over hashes may yield a different order than before due
to changes in the hashing function used.
<P></P>
<LI>
The <CODE>undef</CODE> operator raises an exception when applied to read-only
values.
<P></P>
<LI>
The close-on-exec bit is now set on pipe and socket handles as well,
if you set $^F high enough.
<P></P>
<LI>
<CODE>&quot;$$1&quot;</CODE> always means <CODE>&quot;${$1}&quot;</CODE> now, rather than <CODE>$$ . &quot;1&quot;</CODE> (which
was deprecated in 5.004).
<P></P>
<LI>
delete(), each(), <CODE>values()</CODE> and \(%h) operate on aliases to values,
instead of on copies.  You may need to copy the values explicitly
where needed.
<P></P>
<LI>
<CODE>vec()</CODE> will raise an exception if the BITS argument is not a
power-of-two integer.
<P></P>
<LI>
<CODE>not</CODE> followed by parentheses behaves like a list operator.  This
allows <CODE>grep not($_), @things</CODE> to work as expected, but also changes
<CODE>not (1,2,3)[0]</CODE> to mean <CODE>(not(1,2,3))[0]</CODE> instead of
<CODE>not((1,2,3)[0])</CODE>.
<P></P>
<LI>
The semantics of the bareword prototype (*) have changed to make it
possible to pass barewords, as in many builtins.
<P></P>
<LI>
Bitwise operators on 64-bit platforms operate on the entire native
width rather than just the lower 32 bits.  (You must mask off the
excess bits if you don't want them.)
<P></P>
<LI>
More builtins taint their results due to higher security paranoia,
when perl is running under taint mode (enabled via the -T switch).
<P></P>
<LI>
If you have a perl installation older than 5.005, note that 5.6.1
won't be binary compatible with it.  You will need to recompile
all extensions when upgrading from installations older than 5.005.
(This only applies when building from the source code--ActivePerl
builds based on 5.6.1 are not binary compatible with builds based
on 5.005 and earlier.)

Some versions of tar on Solaris have bugs that prevent proper extraction
of files in a package that has long path names.  Most other versions
of tar on Solaris use a different method than GNU tar to encode pathnames
longer than 100 characters.  GNU tar is therefore required to extract the
package into the filesystem correctly.  A precompiled version of GNU tar
for the sparc platform is available from:

If you are upgrading from build 613, the default location for the
ActivePerl installation when using the native installations on
Unix (Red Hat RPM, Debian dpkg, or Solaris pkgadd) has changed.
Build 613 and earlier installed ActivePerl at /usr/local/perl-5.6,
whereas later builds are installed at /usr/local/ActivePerl-5.6.
This one-time change avoids confusion with locally installed versions
built from the sources, and also avoids installing on top of existing
binary-incompatible installations.
<P></P>
<LI>
This build is not binary compatible with build 613 and earlier.  If
you installed any extensions containing XS code with build 613 or
earlier builds (via PPM or otherwise), you will need to reinstall
them again.
<P></P>
<LI>
The suidperl executable is not included in this package due to potential
security issues.  If you wish to use suidperl in your installation, we
recommend building Perl from source.  The source code for ActivePerl is
available at:

ActivePerl depends on MSVCRT.DLL being installed on the target system.
This file ships with all versions of Windows except for Windows 95. 
If you do not have this file installed on your system you may
experience problems installing and/or running components within ActivePerl.
<P>You can download a self extracting executable that contains MSVCRT.DLL
from:</P>
<PRE>
    <A HREF="ftp://ftp.microsoft.com/softlib/mslfiles/msvcrt.exe">ftp://ftp.microsoft.com/softlib/mslfiles/msvcrt.exe</A></PRE>
<P>Save the file in a temporary directory and double click on it to 
extract the files. Follow the instructions in the ReadMe.txt file 
contained in the package in order to install the missing file.</P>
<P></P>
<LI>
The <CODE>fork()</CODE> emulation has known limitations.  See <EM>perlfork</EM> for a
detailed summary.  In particular, <CODE>fork()</CODE> emulation will not work
correctly with extensions that are either not thread-safe, or maintain
internal state that cannot be cloned in the psuedo-child process.  This
caveat currently applies to extensions such as Tk and Storable.
<P></P>

It seems that numerous people are being bitten by this error from the 
ActivePerl MSI installer. The full text of the error message probably looks 
something lke this:
<PRE>
    Installer Information
    Internal Error 2744. PPM_CONFI, C:\perl\bin.
    &quot;C:\Perl\bin\wPerl.exe&quot; &quot;C:\Perlbin\configPPM.pl&quot;
    &quot;C:\Perl\site\lib\ppm.xml&quot; &quot;D:\downloads\perl\\&quot;
    &quot;C:\Perl\site\lib\ppm.xml~&quot;</PRE>
<P>The first thing to note is that you CANNOT install ActivePerl 5.6 over
an older version of ActivePerl based on 5.005, such as build 522 or any 
500 series build.</P>
<P>We have determined that one cause of this error message is due to other 
installations of Perl that may be pointed at by something in the 
environment.</P>
<P><STRONG>Workaround</STRONG></P>
<P>The sure-fire solution is to make absolutely certain that no other 
installations of Perl are on the target machine. Realizing that this is not 
always possible, you can follow these steps to ensure the other 
installations will not interfere.</P>
<P>1) Stop the ``Windows Installer'' service. This can be accomplished from the 
command prompt using the following command:</P>
<PRE>
    c:\&gt; net stop &quot;Windows Installer&quot;</PRE>
<P>2) Temporarily remove or rename PERLLIB and PERL5LIB environment 
variables in the system environment.</P>
<P>3) Temporarily remove or rename the following registry values:</P>
<PRE>
    [\\HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\Software\Perl] lib = &lt;directory&gt; (REG_SV)
    [\\HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\Software\Perl] sitelib = &lt;directory&gt; (REG_SV)
    [\\HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\Software\Perl] lib-&lt;PerlVersion&gt; = &lt;directory&gt; (REG_SV)
    [\\HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\Software\Perl] sitelib-&lt;PerlVersion&gt; = &lt;directory&gt;(REG_SV)</PRE>
<P>4) Proceed with the installation.</P>
<P>Once the installation has completed successfully, the above actions may be 
undone although restoring the environment variables or the registry values 
may interfere with the proper operation of your new ActivePerl 
installation.</P>
<P>In order to perform all of the above steps, you will need to have 
Administrative privileges on the target machine. If you do not have the 
required privileges you should contact you Administrator.</P>
<P></P>
<LI>
Norton AntiVirus 2000 detects VBS.NewLove.A in the file ActivePerl-Winfaq12.html.
<P><STRONG>Workaround</STRONG></P>
<P>This is a false positive by Norton AntiVirus.  ActivePerl-Winfaq12.html has
been examined by hand, and it is likely that the following example code is
what causes the false report.</P>
<PRE>
    &lt;BLOCKQUOTE&gt;
    &lt;P&gt;&lt;CODE&gt;use strict;&lt;BR&gt;
      use Win32::OLE;&lt;BR&gt;
      use Win32::OLE::Const 'Microsoft Outlook';&lt;BR&gt;
      &lt;BR&gt;
      my $Outlook = Win32::OLE-&amp;gt;new('Outlook.Application', 'Quit');&lt;BR&gt;
      my $ol = Win32::OLE::Const-&amp;gt;Load($Outlook);&lt;BR&gt;
      &lt;BR&gt;
      my $namespace = $Outlook-&amp;gt;GetNamespace(&amp;quot;MAPI&amp;quot;);&lt;BR&gt;
      my $Folder = $namespace-&amp;gt;GetDefaultFolder(olFolderInbox);&lt;BR&gt;
      my $NewFolder = $Folder-&amp;gt;Folders-&amp;gt;Add(&amp;quot;Test1&amp;quot;);&lt;/CODE&gt;&lt;/P&gt;
    &lt;/BLOCKQUOTE&gt;</PRE>
<P>This can be tested by removing the above code from the ActivePerl-Winfaq12.html
file and rescanning with Norton AntiVirus.  Norton AntiVirus will no longer
detect VBS.NewLove.A.</P>
<P>Symantec has been notified of this issue.</P>

<P>The Perl distribution comes with extensive documentation.  On Unix platforms,
all the standard documentation is installed as man pages under the Perl
install location.  The location of the man pages may need to be added to the
MANPATH environment variable in order to access them.  For example, in
the C shell:</P>
<PRE>
    % setenv MANPATH /usr/local/ActivePerl-5.6/man:$MANPATH</PRE>
<P>The documentation is installed in HTML format on all platforms. If ActivePerl
was installed in /usr/local/ActivePerl-5.6 then the HTML documentation
would be located in /usr/local/ActivePerl-5.6/html.</P>
<P>On Windows, the standard documentation along with Windows-specific Perl
documentation is installed in HTML format, and is accessible from the
``Start'' menu.</P>
<P>Updated versions of the HTML documentation will always be available at
the ActiveState website:</P>
