>Almost from the time people first figured out that they could write programs,
they started writing programs that write other programs.  These are called
<EM

RPG stood for Report Program Generator long before it stood for Role
Playing Game.)  Now, anyone who has written a program generator knows that it
can make your eyes go crossed even when you're wide awake.  The problem
is simply that much of your program's data looks like real code, but
isn't (at least not yet).  The same text file contains both stuff that does
something and similar looking stuff that doesn't.  Perl has various
features that make it easier to mix it together with other languages,
textually speaking.</P

language's quoting mechanisms.  You don't have to worry about
indentation, or where you put your line breaks, or whether to backslash
your backslashes yet again.  You aren't forced to define a package as a
single string in advance, since you can slide into your package's namespace
repeatedly, whenever you want to evaluate more code in that package.</P

>Historically, the Perl interpreter has been rather self-contained.  When
Perl was redesigned for Version 5, however, one of the requirements was
that it be possible to write extension modules that could traverse the
parsed syntax tree and emit code in other languages, either low-level
or high-level.  This has now come to pass.</P

>More precisely, this is now coming to pass.  Malcolm Beattie has been
developing a &quot;real compiler&quot; for Perl.  As of this writing, it's in
Alpha 2 state, which means it mostly works, except for the really hard
bits.  The compiler consists of an ordinary Perl parser and
interpreter (since you need to be able to execute <CODE
CLASS="literal"
>BEGIN</CODE
> blocks to
compile Perl), plus a set of modules under the name of B, which is short
for both &quot;Backend&quot; and &quot;Beattie&quot;.  You don't actually invoke the B
module directly though.  Instead you invoke a particular backend via the
O module, which pulls in the B module for you.  Typically you invoke the
O module right on the command line with the <B
CLASS="emphasis.bold"
>-M</B
> switch, so a
compilation command might look like this:</P
><PRE
CLASS="programlisting"
>perl -MO=C foo.pl &gt;foo.c</PRE
><P
CLASS="para"
>There are three backends at the moment.  The C backend rather woodenly
spits out C calls into the ordinary Perl interpreter, but it can
translate almost anything except the most egregious abuses of the
dynamic capabilities of the interpreter.  The Bytecode module is also
fairly complete, and spits out an external Perl bytecode representation,
which can then be read back in and executed by a suitably clued version
of Perl.  Finally, the CC backend attempts to translate into more
idiomatic C with a lot of optimization.  Obviously, that's a bit harder
to do than the other thing.  Nevertheless, it already works on a majority of
the Perl regression tests.  It's possible with some care to get C code
that runs considerably faster than Perl 5's interpreter, which is no
slouch to begin with.  And Malcolm hasn't put in all the optimizations
he wants to yet.</P

CLASS="para"
>This is an ongoing topic of research, but you'll want to keep track of
it.  You are quite likely to be using this someday soon, if you aren't
already.  Look for it on CPAN of course, if it's not already a part
of the standard Perl distribution by the time you read this.</P

extensive online documentation for the internals of Perl.  To include it

>If a respectable number of programs embed a Perl interpreter, then a
veritable flood of extension modules embed C and C++ into Perl.  Again,
the Perl distribution itself does this with many of its standard
extension modules, including DB_File, DynaLoader, Fcntl, FileHandle,
GDBM_File, NDBM_File, ODBM_File, POSIX, Safe, SDBM_File, and Socket.
And many of the modules on CPAN do this.  So if you decide to do it
yourself, you won't feel like you're researching a Ph.D. dissertation.</P
