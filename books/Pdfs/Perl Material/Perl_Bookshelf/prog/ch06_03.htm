>Whether you're dealing with a user sitting at the keyboard typing
commands, or someone sending information across the network, you need to
be careful about the data coming into your programs, since the other
person may, either maliciously or accidentally, send you data that will
do more harm than good.  Perl provides a mechanism to isolate tainted
data so that you won't use it to do something you didn't intend to do.
For instance, if you mistakenly trust a tainted filename, you might end
up appending an entry to your <EM
CLASS="emphasis"
>passwd</EM
> file when you thought you were
appending to a log file.</P
><P
CLASS="para"

to execute, you need to be even more careful.  Perl provides a method of
dealing with that, too.  But first we'll talk about ordinary tainted data.</P

>Perl is designed to make it easy to program securely even when your
program is being used by someone with fewer privileges than the program
itself.  That is, some programs need to grant some extra privileges to
their users, without giving away other privileges that they didn't intend to
give away.  Setuid and setgid programs fall into this category, as do
many network servers, and the programs the servers themselves run, such
as CGI scripts.  At a fundamental level, Perl is easy to program
securely because it's straightforward and self-contained.  Unlike most
command-line shells, which are based on multiple mysterious substitution
passes on each line of the script, Perl uses a more conventional
evaluation scheme with fewer hidden snags.  Additionally, because the
language has more built-in functionality, it can rely less upon external
(and possibly untrustworthy) programs to accomplish its purposes.</P

>The principle is simple:
you may not use data derived from outside your program to affect something
else outside your program&nbsp;- at least, not by accident.  All command-line
arguments, environment variables, and file input are marked as tainted.
Tainted data may not be used directly or indirectly in any command that
invokes a subshell, nor in any command that modifies files, directories,
or processes.  Any variable set within an expression that has previously
referenced a tainted value becomes tainted itself, even if it is logically
impossible for the tainted value to influence the variable.  Because
taintedness is associated with each scalar value, some elements of an
array or hash might be tainted and others not.</P

tests for taintedness even when no process IDs are supplied to send the
signal to.  More important, the function also depends on the fact that
using tainted data anywhere within an expression renders the entire
expression tainted.  It would be inefficient for every operator to test
every argument for taintedness.  Instead, a slightly more efficient and
conservative approach is used: if any tainted value has been accessed
within the same expression, the whole expression is considered tainted.</P

CLASS="para"
>But testing for taintedness only gets you so far.  Usually you know
perfectly well which variables contain tainted data&nbsp;- you just have to
clear the data's taintedness.  The only way to bypass the tainting
mechanism is by referencing subpattern variables set by an earlier
regular expression match.  The presumption is that if you reference a
substring using <B
CLASS="emphasis.bold"
>$1</B
>, <B
CLASS="emphasis.bold"
>$2</B
>, 
and so on, you knew what you were doing when
you wrote the pattern, and wrote it to weed out anything dangerous.  So
you need to give it a bit of thought&nbsp;- don't just blindly untaint
anything, or you defeat the entire mechanism.  Also, it's better to
verify that the variable has only good characters rather than checking
whether it has any bad characters.  That's because it's far too easy to
miss bad characters that you never thought of.</P

and each directory in the path must be non-writable by anyone other than
the directory's owner and group.  You may be surprised to get this
message even when the filename of your executable is absolute
(that is, fully qualified from the root of your filesystem).
True, when you supply an absolute filename, the PATH isn't used to locate
the executable.  However, Perl doesn't trust the program you're running
not to turn right around and execute some other program using the 
insecure PATH.  So it forces you to set a secure PATH anyway.</P

TITLE="open"
><B

Now the child resets its user and group IDs (and any other per-process
attributes, like environment variables, umasks, current working
directories) back to the originals or known safe values.  Then the child
process, which no longer has any special permissions, does the <A

>Beyond the obvious problems that stem from giving special privileges to
interpreters as flexible and inscrutable as shells, many versions of
UNIX have the additional difficulty that any setuid script is inherently
insecure before it ever gets to the interpreter.  That is, the problem
is not the script itself, but a race condition in the way kernel invokes
an interpreter mentioned on the <CODE

machines that don't recognize <CODE

>Fortunately, sometimes this kernel &quot;feature&quot; can be disabled.
Unfortunately, there are two ways to disable it.  The system can
outlaw scripts with the setuid bit set, which doesn't help much.
Alternately, it can ignore the setuid bit on scripts.  If the
latter is true, Perl can emulate the setuid and setgid mechanism when it
notices the (otherwise useless) setuid/gid bits on Perl scripts.  It does
this via a special executable called <EM

trick you into doing something bad.  Taint checking is the sort of security
blanket that's useful for setuid programs and programs launched on
someone else's behalf, like CGI programs.</P

code you're running.  What if you fetch an applet off the Net and it
contains a virus, or a time bomb, or a Trojan horse?  Taint checking is
useless here, because the code itself may be tainted, while the data
you're feeding it presumably is not.  You're placing yourself in the
position of someone who receives a mysterious device from a stranger,
with a note that says, &quot;Just hold this to your head and pull the
trigger.&quot;  Maybe you think it will dry your hair, but you might not think
so for very long.</P

system in which you can impose a quarantine on suspicious code.  The
code can continue to exist, and even perform certain functions, but you
don't let it wander around doing anything it feels like doing.  In Perl,
you can impose a kind of quarantine using the Safe module.</P

TITLE="The Standard Perl Library"

CLASS="para"

is to keep the bad people in, not out.  In the UNIX world, there is a system

>(2) that can permanently consign a process to run
only in a subdirectory of the directory structure, in its own private little
hell, if you will.  Once the process is put there, there is no way
whatsoever for it to reach anything outside, because there's no way for
it to name anything outside.  A Safe object is a little like that,
except that instead of being restricted to a subset of the directory
structure, it's restricted to a subset of Perl's package structure, which
is hierarchical just as the directory structure is.  It suffices to give
the Safe object its own &quot;main package&quot;, so that it can't influence the rest of
your program.</P
><P
CLASS="para"
>The other important thing about a Safe object is that it limits the
operations available to the tainted code.  The details of this
aren't important here, but what is important is that this is under the
control of your code.  And since you can create multiple Safe objects in
your program, you can confer various degrees of trust upon various chunks
of code, depending on where you got them from.  Or more importantly, on whom
you got them from.  This leads us to the notion of Penguin.</P

code you get from someone (and you have to, if you think about it), you
must also trust the mechanism by which the trustworthy code is
delivered to you.  In the good old days, of course, we just ignored the
problem, but these days if you do that you get infected by a virus.
So we're moving toward the day in which most software will be delivered
with an encrypted seal guaranteeing that it comes from where you think
it comes from, and that it hasn't been tampered with in the meanwhile.</P

signed Perl code (termed &quot;executable content&quot; in Marketese) to a remote machine
to be executed.  At the other end, it lets you receive code and,
depending on who signed it, execute it within the constraints of an
arbitrarily secure Safe object.  You'll note that we didn't say which
end was the client and which end was the server.  This was intentional,
because it doesn't really matter.</P

mobile information-gathering agents, distribute &quot;live content&quot;
web-browser helper applications, perform distributed load-balanced
computation, update remote software, administer distant machines,
propagate content-based information, build Internet-wide shared-data
applications and network application builders, and so on.  And it's
completely non-proprietary.</P

CLASS="para"
>Penguin-as-a-concept grew from early thinking about agent-tcl, a
language I made up during a heated discussion with the safe-tcl
people.  Tcl proved to be an inappropriate implementation language.
Soon after I stopped trying, Sun's Java language arrived on the scene,
purporting to solve many of the issues I had thought were important.
However, although superior to tcl, Java is also an inappropriate
and difficult implementation language.  Hence Perl, hence Penguin.</P
><P
CLASS="para"
>Penguin, with its vastly simplified, superior, and innate methods of
ensuring safety and security, may become a very interesting tool in
the repertoires of the many thousands of Perl programmers already
extant on the Internet.  Once people discover the glass walls of
Java and the inconsistencies and insecurities engendered in the
other solutions, we may begin to live in interesting times.</P

well.  The next section should help with that.</P

not yet included as part of the standard Perl distribution.  That
