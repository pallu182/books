and think about what will do the most good for you and your neighbor

>The first step toward ecologically sustainable programming is simply:
don't litter in the park.  When you write a chunk of code, think about
giving the code its own namespace, so that your variables and functions
don't clobber anyone else's, or vice versa.  A namespace is a bit like
your home, where you're allowed to be as messy as you like, as long
as you keep your external interface to other citizens moderately civil.
In Perl, a namespace is called a <EM
CLASS="emphasis"
>package</EM
>.  Packages provide the
fundamental building block upon which the higher-level concepts of
modules and classes are constructed.</P
><P
CLASS="para"
>Like the notion of &quot;home&quot;, the notion of &quot;package&quot; is a bit nebulous.
Packages are independent of files.  You can have many packages in a
single file, or a single package that spans several files, just as your
home could be one part of a larger building, if you live in an apartment, or could comprise several
buildings, if your name happens to be Queen Elizabeth.  But the usual
size of a home is one building, and the usual size of a package is one
file.  Perl has some special help for people who want to put one package
in one file, as long as you're willing to name the file with the same
name as the package and give your file an extension of &quot;<EM

which is short for &quot;perl module&quot;. The <EM
CLASS="emphasis"
>module</EM

reusability in Perl.  Indeed, the way you <EM

<A
CLASS="xref"
HREF="ch03_185.htm"
TITLE="use"
><B

The concept of classes therefore cuts across the concepts of files and
modules.  But the typical class is nevertheless implemented with a
module.  (If you're starting to get the feeling that much of Perl culture
is governed by mere convention, then you're starting to get the right
feeling, civilly speaking.  The trend over the last 20 years or so has
been to design computer languages that enforce a state of paranoia.
You're expected to program every module as if it were in a state of
siege.  Certainly there are some feudal cultures where this is
appropriate, but not all cultures are like this.  In Perl culture, by
contrast, you're expected to stay out of someone's home because you
weren't invited in, not because there are bars[<A

>Anyway, back to classes.  When you <B

you're benefiting from the direct reuse of the software that implements
that module.  But with object classes you can get the additional
benefits of <EM
CLASS="emphasis"
>indirect</EM
> software reuse when the class you're using turns
around and reuses other classes that it gets some characteristics
from.  But this is not primarily a book about object-oriented
methodology, and we're not here to convert you into a raving
object-oriented zealot, even if you want to be converted.  There are
already plenty of books out there for that.
Perl's philosophy of object-oriented design fits right in with Perl's
philosophy of everything else: use object-oriented design where it makes
sense, and avoid it where it doesn't.  Your call.</P
><P
CLASS="para"
>As we mentioned in the previous chapter, object-oriented programming in
Perl is accomplished through use of references that happen to refer to
thingies that know which class they're associated with.  In fact, now
that you know about references, you know almost everything hard about
objects.  The rest of it just &quot;lays under the fingers&quot;, as a violinist
would say.  You will need to practice a little, though.</P
><P
CLASS="para"
>In this chapter we will discuss creation and use of packages, modules,
and classes.  Then we will review some of the essentials of
object-oriented programming, explain how references become objects, and
illustrate how these objects are manipulated as members
of one or more classes.  We'll also tell you how to <B

variables into object classes to turn them into magical variables.</P

>Perl provides a mechanism to protect different sections of code from
inadvertently tampering with each other's variables.  In fact, apart
from certain magical variables, there's really no such thing as a global
variable in Perl.  Code is always compiled in the <EM
CLASS="emphasis"
>current package</EM
>.
The initial current package is package main, but at any time you can
switch the current package to another one using the <A
CLASS="xref"
HREF="ch03_106.htm"
TITLE="package"
><B
CLASS="xref.cmd"

declaration.  The current package determines which symbol table is used
for name lookups (for names that aren't otherwise package-qualified).
The notion of &quot;current package&quot; is both a compile-time and run-time
concept.  Most name lookups happen at compile-time, but run-time lookups
happen when symbolic references are dereferenced, and also when new bits
of code are parsed under <A

All subsequent identifiers (except those declared with <A

put it at the end of a block, in which case it would have no effect
whatsoever.  You can switch into a package in more than one place; it
merely influences which symbol table is used by the compiler for the
rest of that block.  (This is how a given package can span more than
one file.)</P

This is important because subroutine declarations change how the rest
of the file will be parsed.  At the very least, declaring a subroutine
allows it to be used as a list operator, without parentheses.  And if
the subroutine is declared with a prototype, then calls to that
subroutine may be parsed like any of several built-in functions
(depending on which prototype is used).</P
