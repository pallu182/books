How to find ct dump -l foo.c@@
	@@ means dumping the element object related to the file , not the version selected by the view

cleartool find . -type d -exec 'cleartool describe -fmt "%On, %En\\n" $CLEARCASE_PN@@'??
	gives all the evil twins in the directory

ct lshistory -l .@@ 
	gives the history of the current directory
	Uncatalogued means it was ct rmnamed
	Added - means added new file was checked in that directory
