An object is simply a special kind of thingy that happens to know which
class it's associated with.  Constructors know how to create that
association.  They do so by taking an ordinary thingy and turning it
into an object (which remains a thingy even while it's also being an
object).  The operator that a constructor uses to do this is called<A

Constructors are 
customarily named <CODE

They're usually called in one of two ways:</P

>However, if you don't need to refer to existing named filehandles, you
should consider using one of the newer, object-oriented library modules
that provide filehandle objects via a constructor (see the previous
section).  In either case, you won't use filehandle names directly, but
rather you'll use scalars (as above) to hold a reference to
something that will (one way or another) be interpreted as a
filehandle.  As we admitted earlier, there is some implicit
dereferencing magic going on here.</P
