<H1><A NAME="description">DESCRIPTION</A></H1>
<P>This will declare a symbol to be a constant with the given scalar
or list value.</P>
<P>When you declare a constant such as <CODE>PI</CODE> using the method shown
above, each machine your script runs upon can have as many digits
of accuracy as it can use. Also, your program will be easier to
read, more likely to be maintained (and maintained correctly), and
far less likely to send a space probe to the wrong planet because
nobody noticed the one equation in which you wrote <CODE>3.14195</CODE>.</P>
<P>
<HR>
<H1><A NAME="notes">NOTES</A></H1>
<P>The value or values are evaluated in a list context. You may override
this with <A HREF="../lib/Pod/perlfunc.html#item_scalar"><CODE>scalar</CODE></A> as shown above.</P>
<P>These constants do not directly interpolate into double-quotish
strings, although you may do so indirectly. (See <A HREF="../lib/Pod/perlref.html">the perlref manpage</A> for
details about how this works.)</P>
<PRE>
    print &quot;The value of PI is @{[ PI ]}.\n&quot;;</PRE>
<P>List constants are returned as lists, not as arrays.</P>
<PRE>
    $homedir = USERINFO[7];             # WRONG
    $homedir = (USERINFO)[7];           # Right</PRE>
<P>The use of all caps for constant names is merely a convention,
although it is recommended in order to make constants stand out
and to help avoid collisions with other barewords, keywords, and
subroutine names. Constant names must begin with a letter or
underscore. Names beginning with a double underscore are reserved. Some
poor choices for names will generate warnings, if warnings are enabled at
compile time.</P>
<P>Constant symbols are package scoped (rather than block scoped, as
<CODE>use strict</CODE> is). That is, you can refer to a constant from package
Other as <CODE>Other::CONST</CODE>.</P>
<P>As with all <A HREF="../lib/Pod/perlfunc.html#item_use"><CODE>use</CODE></A> directives, defining a constant happens at
compile time. Thus, it's probably not correct to put a constant
declaration inside of a conditional statement (like <CODE>if ($foo)
{ use constant ... }</CODE>).</P>
<P>Omitting the value for a symbol gives it the value of <A HREF="../lib/Pod/perlfunc.html#item_undef"><CODE>undef</CODE></A> in
a scalar context or the empty list, <CODE>()</CODE>, in a list context. This
isn't so nice as it may sound, though, because in this case you
must either quote the symbol name, or use a big arrow, (<CODE>=&gt;</CODE>),
with nothing to point to. It is probably best to declare these
explicitly.</P>
<PRE>
    use constant UNICORNS       =&gt; ();
    use constant LOGFILE        =&gt; undef;</PRE>
<P>The result from evaluating a list constant in a scalar context is
not documented, and is <STRONG>not</STRONG> guaranteed to be any particular value
in the future. In particular, you should not rely upon it being
the number of elements in the list, especially since it is not
<STRONG>necessarily</STRONG> that value in the current implementation.</P>
<P>Magical values, tied values, and references can be made into
constants at compile time, allowing for way cool stuff like this.
(These error numbers aren't totally portable, alas.)</P>
<PRE>
    use constant E2BIG =&gt; ($! = 7);
    print   E2BIG, &quot;\n&quot;;        # something like &quot;Arg list too long&quot;
    print 0+E2BIG, &quot;\n&quot;;        # &quot;7&quot;</PRE>
<P>Dereferencing constant references incorrectly (such as using an array
subscript on a constant hash reference, or vice versa) will be trapped at
compile time.</P>
<P>In the rare case in which you need to discover at run time whether a
particular constant has been declared via this module, you may use
this function to examine the hash <CODE>%constant::declared</CODE>. If the given
constant name does not include a package name, the current package is
used.</P>
<PRE>
    sub declared ($) {
        use constant 1.01;              # don't omit this!
        my $name = shift;
        $name =~ s/^::/main::/;
        my $pkg = caller;
        my $full_name = $name =~ /::/ ? $name : &quot;${pkg}::$name&quot;;
        $constant::declared{$full_name};
    }</PRE>
<P>
<HR>
<H1><A NAME="technical note">TECHNICAL NOTE</A></H1>
<P>In the current implementation, scalar constants are actually
inlinable subroutines. As of version 5.004 of Perl, the appropriate
scalar constant is inserted directly in place of some subroutine
calls, thereby saving the overhead of a subroutine call. See
<A HREF="../lib/Pod/perlsub.html#constant functions">Constant Functions in the perlsub manpage</A> for details about how and when this
happens.</P>
<P>
<HR>
<H1><A NAME="bugs">BUGS</A></H1>
<P>In the current version of Perl, list constants are not inlined
and some symbols may be redefined without generating a warning.</P>
<P>It is not possible to have a subroutine or keyword with the same
name as a constant in the same package. This is probably a Good Thing.</P>
<P>A constant with a name in the list <CODE>STDIN STDOUT STDERR ARGV ARGVOUT
ENV INC SIG</CODE> is not allowed anywhere but in package <CODE>main::</CODE>, for
technical reasons.</P>
<P>Even though a reference may be declared as a constant, the reference may
point to data which may be changed, as this code shows.</P>
<PRE>
    use constant CARRAY         =&gt; [ 1,2,3,4 ];
    print CARRAY-&gt;[1];
    CARRAY-&gt;[1] = &quot; be changed&quot;;
    print CARRAY-&gt;[1];</PRE>
<P>Unlike constants in some languages, these cannot be overridden
on the command line or via environment variables.</P>
<P>You can get into trouble if you use constants in a context which
automatically quotes barewords (as is true for any subroutine call).
For example, you can't say <CODE>$hash{CONSTANT}</CODE> because <CODE>CONSTANT</CODE> will
be interpreted as a string.  Use <CODE>$hash{CONSTANT()}</CODE> or
<CODE>$hash{+CONSTANT}</CODE> to prevent the bareword quoting mechanism from
kicking in.  Similarly, since the <CODE>=&gt;</CODE> operator quotes a bareword
immediately to its left, you have to say <CODE>CONSTANT() =&gt; 'value'</CODE>
(or simply use a comma in place of the big arrow) instead of
<CODE>CONSTANT =&gt; 'value'</CODE>.</P>
