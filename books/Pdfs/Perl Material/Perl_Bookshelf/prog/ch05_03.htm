>Perl doesn't provide any special syntax for constructors.  A constructor
is merely a subroutine that returns a reference to a thingy that it has
blessed into a class, generally the class in which the subroutine is
defined.  The constructor does this using the built-in <A
CLASS="xref"
HREF="ch03_009.htm"
TITLE="bless"
><B
CLASS="xref.cmd"
>bless</B
></A
> function,
which marks a thingy as belonging to a particular class.  It takes
either one or two arguments: the first argument is a regular hard reference
to any kind of thingy, and the second argument (if present) is the
package that will own the thingy.  If no second argument is supplied,
the current package is assumed.  Here is a typical constructor:</P
><PRE
CLASS="programlisting"
>package Critter;
sub new { return bless {}; }</PRE
><P
CLASS="para"
>The <CODE
CLASS="literal"
>{}</CODE
> composes a reference to an empty anonymous hash.
The <A
CLASS="xref"
HREF="ch03_009.htm"
TITLE="bless"
><B
CLASS="xref.cmd"
>bless</B
></A
> function takes that hash reference and tells the thingy
it references that it's now a member of the class Critter, and returns the
reference.
The same thing can be accomplished more explicitly this way:</P
><PRE
CLASS="programlisting"
>sub new {
    my     $obref = {};         # ref to empty hash
    bless  $obref;              # make it an object in this class

><P
CLASS="para"
>Sometimes constructors call other methods in the class as part of the
construction.  Here we'll call an <CODE
CLASS="literal"

> method, which
may be in the current package or in one of the classes (packages) that
this class inherits from.  The leading underscore is an oft-used convention
indicating that the function is private, that is, to be used
only by the class itself.  This result can also be achieved by omitting
the function from the published documentation for that class.</P
><PRE
CLASS="programlisting"

you must use the two-argument form of <A
CLASS="xref"

>bless</B

Perl, methods execute in the context of the original base class rather
than in the context of the derived class.  For example, suppose you have
a Polygon class that had a <CODE
CLASS="literal"

would work fine when called as <CODE
CLASS="literal"
>Polygon-&gt;new()</CODE

decide to also have a Square class, which inherits methods from the
Polygon class.  The only way for that constructor to build an object of
the proper class when it is called as <CODE
CLASS="literal"

the two-argument form of <A

>Within the class package, methods will typically deal with the reference
as an ordinary (unblessed) reference to a thingy.  Outside the class
package, the reference should generally be treated as an opaque value that
may only be accessed through the class's methods.  (Mutually consenting
classes may of course do whatever they like with each other, but even
that doesn't necessarily make it right.)</P

CLASS="para"

><PRE
CLASS="programlisting"
>$a = {};            # generate reference to hash
$b = $a;            # reference assignment (shallow)

member of class <CODE

underlying thingy that <CODE

>Perl classes do only method inheritance.  Data inheritance is left
up to the class itself.  By and large, this is not a problem in Perl,
because most classes model the attributes of their object using
an anonymous hash.  All the object's data fields (termed &quot;instance
variables&quot; in some languages) are contained within this anonymous hash instead of
being part of the language itself.  This hash serves as its own little
namespace to be carved up by the various classes that might want to do
something with the object.  For example, if you want an object called
<CODE
CLASS="literal"
>$user_info</CODE
> to have a data field named <CODE
CLASS="literal"
>age</CODE
>, you can simply
access <CODE
CLASS="literal"

(The class name isn't blessed; it's just a string.)  These methods
provide functionality for the class as a whole, not for any individual
object instance belonging to the class.  Constructors are typically
written as class methods.  Many class methods simply ignore their first
argument, since they already know what package they're in, and don't
care what package they were invoked via.  (These aren't necessarily the
same, since class methods follow the inheritance tree just like ordinary
instance methods.)</P

Properly speaking, none of these is a function
invocation.  Rather, Perl uses the information presented via the syntax
to determine which function to call.
